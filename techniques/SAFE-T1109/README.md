# SAFE-T1109: Debugging Tool Exploitation

## Overview
**Tactic**: Execution (ATK-TA0002)  
**Technique ID**: SAFE-T1109  
**Severity**: Critical  
**First Observed**: June 2025 (CVE-2025-49596)  
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-09

## Description
Debugging Tool Exploitation is an attack technique where adversaries exploit vulnerabilities in MCP development and debugging tools to achieve remote code execution. This technique specifically targets the MCP Inspector, Anthropic's official debugging tool for MCP servers, which contains a critical vulnerability (CVE-2025-49596) that allows unauthenticated remote code execution through browser-based attacks.

The MCP Inspector consists of two components: a React-based web UI and a Node.js proxy server. The vulnerability stems from the lack of authentication between these components and the default configuration binding to all network interfaces (0.0.0.0), creating a significant attack surface that can be exploited from malicious websites.

## Attack Vectors
- **Primary Vector**: Browser-based Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks targeting localhost services
- **Secondary Vectors**: 
  - DNS rebinding attacks to bypass Same-Origin Policy
  - Direct network access to exposed MCP Inspector instances
  - Social engineering to trick developers into visiting malicious websites
  - Exploitation of exposed internet-facing MCP Inspector services

## Technical Details

### Prerequisites
- Target must be running MCP Inspector versions prior to 0.14.1
- MCP Inspector proxy must be accessible (default port 6277)
- For browser-based attacks: victim must visit attacker-controlled web page

### Attack Flow
1. **Initial Stage**: Attacker identifies target running vulnerable MCP Inspector
2. **Delivery**: Victim visits malicious website or attacker accesses exposed service directly
3. **Exploitation**: Malicious JavaScript sends crafted requests to MCP Inspector proxy
4. **Command Execution**: Proxy executes arbitrary commands via stdio transport
5. **Post-Exploitation**: Attacker gains full system access and can establish persistence

### Example Scenario
**Browser-based RCE via 0.0.0.0-day:**
```javascript
// Malicious JavaScript payload
fetch("http://0.0.0.0:6277/sse?transportType=stdio&command=calc.exe", {
    "method": "GET",
    "mode": "no-cors",
    "credentials": "omit"
});
```

**Direct SSE endpoint exploitation:**
```bash
# Direct command execution via GET request
curl "http://target:6277/sse?transportType=stdio&command=whoami&args="
```

### Advanced Attack Techniques (2025 Research)

According to security researchers from [Oligo Security](https://www.oligo.security/blog/critical-rce-vulnerability-in-anthropic-mcp-inspector-cve-2025-49596) and independent researchers ([blog.jaisal.dev](https://blog.jaisal.dev/articles/mcp)), sophisticated variations include:

1. **DNS Rebinding Bypass**: Using dynamic DNS records to change from attacker IP to localhost, bypassing browser security controls ([Singularity of Origin](http://rebind.it) technique)
2. **0.0.0.0-day Exploitation**: Leveraging the 19-year-old browser vulnerability where 0.0.0.0 is treated as localhost but bypasses security restrictions
3. **Internet-wide Scanning**: Automated discovery of exposed MCP Inspector instances using fingerprinting techniques ([researchers found 104+ exposed instances](https://blog.jaisal.dev/articles/mcp))

## Impact Assessment
- **Confidentiality**: High - Full file system and memory access
- **Integrity**: High - Ability to modify system files and install malware
- **Availability**: High - Can disrupt services or cause denial of service
- **Scope**: Network-wide - Can pivot to connected systems and networks

### Current Status (2025)
The vulnerability was responsibly disclosed and patched by Anthropic in June 2025:
- **CVE-2025-49596** assigned with CVSS score 9.4 (Critical)
- **Fixed in version 0.14.1** with session token authentication and origin validation
- **GitHub Security Advisory** published: [GHSA-7f8r-222p-6f5g](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector/security/advisories/GHSA-7f8r-222p-6f5g)

However, many installations may remain vulnerable due to:
- Manual upgrade requirements for global npm installations
- Project-specific installations in node_modules
- Continued use of older versions in CI/CD pipelines

## Detection Methods

### Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)
- Unusual process spawning from Node.js MCP proxy processes
- Network connections to unexpected external hosts from development machines
- Suspicious GET requests to port 6277 with command parameters
- MCP Inspector running on 0.0.0.0 instead of localhost
- Unexpected calculator or system applications launching during development

### Detection Rules

**Important**: The following rule is written in Sigma format and contains example patterns only. Organizations should:
- Monitor HTTP access logs for MCP Inspector endpoints
- Use process monitoring to detect unusual child processes from Node.js
- Implement network monitoring for unexpected outbound connections
- Consider semantic analysis of HTTP parameters for command injection patterns

### Behavioral Indicators
- MCP Inspector processes spawning unexpected child processes
- Development environments connecting to external IP addresses during coding sessions
- Browser requests to localhost ports from unknown websites
- Node.js processes with unusual network activity patterns

## Mitigation Strategies

### Preventive Controls
1. **[SAFE-M-24: Version Management](../../mitigations/SAFE-M-24/README.md)**: Upgrade MCP Inspector to version 0.14.1 or later immediately
2. **[SAFE-M-25: Network Binding Restrictions](../../mitigations/SAFE-M-25/README.md)**: Configure development tools to bind only to localhost (127.0.0.1) rather than all interfaces (0.0.0.0)
3. **[SAFE-M-26: Authentication Controls](../../mitigations/SAFE-M-26/README.md)**: Enable session token authentication for all debugging and development tools
4. **[SAFE-M-27: Firewall Rules](../../mitigations/SAFE-M-27/README.md)**: Block external access to development tool ports (6277, 6274) at network level
5. **[SAFE-M-28: Browser Security](../../mitigations/SAFE-M-28/README.md)**: Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) and other browser hardening measures

### Detective Controls
