# SAFE-M-5: Content Sanitization

## Overview
**Mitigation ID**: SAFE-M-5  
**Category**: Input Validation  
**Effectiveness**: Medium  
**Implementation Complexity**: Low-Medium  
**First Published**: 2025-01-03

## Description
Content Sanitization filters MCP-related content (including tool descriptions, tool outputs, error messages, and other data) to remove hidden content and instruction patterns using pattern-based detection combined with structural analysis. This mitigation applies sanitization at multiple points in the MCP pipeline to prevent prompt injection from various sources. Note that pattern-based filtering alone is insufficient and should be combined with other mitigations.
