# SAFE-M-10: Automated Scanning

## Overview
**Mitigation ID**: SAFE-M-10  
**Category**: Detective Control  
**Effectiveness**: Medium  
**Implementation Complexity**: Low-Medium  
**First Published**: 2025-01-03

## Description
Automated Scanning regularly scans all MCP-related content (tool descriptions, tool outputs, error messages, and API responses) for known malicious patterns and hidden content using signature-based detection, heuristics, and anomaly detection to identify potential threats. This includes real-time scanning of tool outputs before they reach the LLM.
